## Core Features

### 1. Smart Coding Environment
- In-browser code editor with syntax highlighting  
- Run code safely in isolated Docker containers  
- Supports Python, Java, JavaScript, C++  
- Store all solutions for later review  

### 2. AI Interview Simulator
- **Technical Interviews:** Real coding questions with AI guidance  
- **Behavioral Interviews:** AI analyzes communication skills  
- **Instant Feedback:** "Explain your logic more clearly"  
- **Progress Tracking:** Interview readiness score  

### 3. Performance Analytics
- **Student View:** Personal progress charts, weak areas  
- **Professor Dashboard:** Class overview, individual student tracking  
- **University Insights:** Placement readiness across departments  

### 4. Peer Collaboration
- Live Pair Programming: Code together in real-time  
- Study Groups: Practice interviews with classmates  
- Code Sharing: Get help from peers on difficult problems

## Sample Flow

### Student Experience:
1. Logs in → Sees 10 new problems assigned by professor  
2. Solves "Two Sum" problem → Gets instant feedback and score  
3. Takes AI mock interview → Receives improvement suggestions  
4. Joins study group → Collaborates on algorithms with classmates  

### Professor Experience:
1. Assigns weekly problem sets to Data Structures class  
2. Reviews class performance → Notices 60% struggle with recursion  
3. Schedules extra recursion practice session  
4. Tracks student interview readiness before placement season

## Tech Requirements
- **Frontend:** React.js with Monaco Editor (VS Code-style coding)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with secure Docker containers for code execution  
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT for interview questions and feedback  
- **Collaboration:** Socket.io for real-time pair programming  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for user data and problem sets
